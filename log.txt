Planning for the quarter:
The goal is to take the tweets of the top hate groups on twitter and perform topic modeling on
a) the tweet text b) the linked article headlines c) the linked article text
Then the goal is to convert these into a time series by topic and compare this with the time
series of hate group tweets by activity. 

The steps are: 
1) extract links from tweets (regex)
2) get article headlines, text from tweets (Newspaper, https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper)
3) Perform topic modeling on tweet text, article text, and headline (Mallet)
4) Convert to time series
5) Perform time series comparisons (Granger, Other methods TBD)
